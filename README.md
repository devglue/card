# Card
A web component with a card layout created using Angular Elements

## WIP
This project is just starting up. Only the scaffold for the Angular Element has been created so far. Please check back in the near future!!

## Build
Package json has couple of build scripts to build the project. Use `npm run [scriptname]` to create a build. The names of the scripts are intentionally kept long to describe what their outputs looks like.

## Run
Globally install live server with the command `npm i live-server -g`. Then run this command from the root folder `npm run run`. It should display an HTML page on your default browser. The page contains the card component as an Angular Element.
